  Creating data
  There are two core objects in pandas: the DataFrame and the Series.

  DataFrame
  A DataFrame is a table. It contains an array of individual entries, each of which has a certain value. Each entry corresponds to a row (or record) and a column.

  For example, consider the following simple DataFrame:

  pd.DataFrame({'Yes': [50, 21], 'No': [131, 2]})
  
  pd.DataFrame({'Bob': ['I liked it.', 'It was awful.'], 'Sue': ['Pretty good.', 'Bland.']})
